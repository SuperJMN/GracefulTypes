# Graceful Types
## Discover Types and gracefully

Lots of advanced programming techniques rely on the concept of **Type**:
- You may have already tried to configure a container to register (export) a set of types.
- Or you may have used .NET reflection to do cool stuff

... and soon after, you realized that working with **Types** isn't as terse as one would want.

With this library, you will have a nicer experience discovering types at run time so you can filter them out to your needs without any trouble.
